# Projects 

You've found my work! Sorted from newest to oldest here are some of my projects.

- [Neural Network email classification](https://github.com/vilius-git/NN-email-class)

Based on the Enron corpus, emails were parsed, tokenized and their sequences used to create clusters. Three types of neural network models were created and their performance compared on predicting the classes. 

- [Airline safety analysis and visualization](https://github.com/vilius-git/DSC-640-Airline)

The projects goal was to shift the perception of a company, where in the scenario recent airline safety threats had caught media attention. Data was used to present a clear picture of the actual situation. The final product is an info graphic containing various visualizations based on Multiple airplane safety data datasets. 

- [Prediction of graduate admissions](https://github.com/vilius-git/DSC550Final)

The project circles around a dataset provided by Kaggle containing various Scores and measurements of performance. 3 Regression Models were completed upon the test dataset split to select the best one.

- [Data preparation](https://github.com/vilius-git/DSC540Final)

The Project consists of building a dataset by combining 3 different kinds of data sources. A CSV file that contains policy data for 100 major police departments. Web Scraping was utilized to collect Organization IDâ€™s and names of departments to use for the API. An FBI API was used combined with the prior Data to collect specific counts of various crimes. The information was joined between the scraped and API data, unfortunately the CSV file did not contain enough specific Organization Identification to join the last dataset.

- [The effects of co-morbidities on Covid-19 Cases and Deaths](https://github.com/vilius-git/DSC530Final)

This project explored a dataset of cases and deaths among counties in the United States, it was used together with a health rankings to investigate at a county level the effects of comorbidity rankings on the number of cases and deaths. Several types of models were tested and selected for possible modeling of deaths according to a counties health rankings.

- [Weather API intergration](https://github.com/vilius-git/weather-api-zip)

This program takes as input a zip code and queries the json data from openweathermap.org, parses the necessary information and returns the relative information.

- [Programming concepts](https://github.com/vilius-git/programming-concepts)

This is a compilation of assignments from my DSC 510 Intro to Programming course. Code is in python and mostly features concepts like classes, functions and an API intergration.
