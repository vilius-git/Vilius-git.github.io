# About me
![A picture of me](my-picture.png)

My name is Vilius Smilinskas I am Lithuanian and have been living in Orlando, Florida for the past 10 years. Here I finished high school, graduated from the University of Central Florida with a degree in Interdisciplinary Studies and soon to be completing my Master's degree at Bellevue University. Here I also got married and we are excited for the arrival of out second boy in May of 2021.

My journey with Data started when working at the First Baptist Church of Windermere, there I was introduced to MinistryPlatform, a MySQL database that our church was migrating to. It was then that I realized the potential of even simple automated tasks to provide actionable data for our team to interact with. Creating reports of interactions with the students in our ministry, which allowed us to better engage our student population of around 300 students. When I joined Disney to be a part of the Telecom Technical Services team, I continued to learn and interact with data. Here I was able to take part in the Aspire program through which I started my Master's degree in Data Science at Bellevue University. Which proved useful in the wokrplace immediately.

Throughout my studies I have most focused on develompent through Python, with several projects completed with R. During my courses I covered concepts starting from Statistical methods and analysis, data wrangling, exploratative data analysis, predictive analytics, data visualization and storytelling, data mining, machine learning and deep learning. The projects bellow will act as a showcase of my work during my studies and beyond. Moving forward I would like to put my studies to work in a position that strengthens my skills and allows me to boost any organization I join.
