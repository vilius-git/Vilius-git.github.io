# About

This should include your name, a photo, your title and a paragraph or two about who you are, what you’ve done, and where you’d like to go next. Don’t be afraid to dive into deeper detail on your portfolio, spend meaningful time developing your narrative and telling your story. This is also an important part of developing your brand. Discover what makes you unique and stand out from the rest and share that with your readers!

# Contact Me

Every successful portfolio will have a section where a viewer can contact you. At the very least, make sure your LinkedIn, GitHub, and Email address are available forms of contact.

# Projects 

Your projects section is the main reason you have a portfolio in the first place, so you’ll want to make this section POP! Unlike your resume, you can display the full list of your programming projects, however, you’ll still want to highlight a select few. Get your viewers excited about your projects by including quick video demos, GIFS, or images of your projects.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/vilius-git/Vilius-git.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
